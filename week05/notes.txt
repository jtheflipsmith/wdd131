Pattern Attribute:

   Enables you to set a required pattern in your field within the form. User input
must match the pattern in order to be considered valid.

   Same expression syntax as javascript

   Regular Expressions - Feature in most programming languages to specify patterns
of characters. (Famously indecipherable to the uninitiated)

    EXAMPLE:
    -------

<li>
<label for="password">I would like my password to be:</label>
<p>(at least 6 characters, no spaces)</p>
<input type="password" id="password" name="password" required title="(at least 6 characters, no spaces)" pattern="\S{6}">
</li>

\S - refers to "any nonwhitespace characters," 
{6,} - means at least six times. 

stipulating a max amount of characters would ook like this:

\S{6, 10} - 6 being minimum, and 10 being the maximum
